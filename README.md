#  An opensource Prayer-Sharing App
>  An opensource Prayer-Sharing WebAPP

I should't have built this with laravel though but wanted to build this as fast as I could. 
All it does not is display ramdom prayers from the Holy Qur'an. I woiud probably add the feature to add more prayers when free.
Feel free to contribute.

I created a Python Script that Tweet this prayers daily. So you can follow at  [https://twitter.com/islamvibe](https://twitter.com/islamvibe). Thank you
